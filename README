I have placed everyones work in a single folder
I have used os.dir so as long as you keep the folders the way they are main will be able to fetch all images
I havent uploaded the test and training images so be sure to put them into it before you run main
Step 3 is fully done except for the image patches part but im sort of stuck on it, will work on it until deadline after i get home from work
Sorry my python is absolutely terrible, but I havent used it since GCSE (lol, back in the easy days RIP)
Before deadline we need to go through it, comment it and make sure it all runs the way we wish.

I will send over my report by tomorrows deadline with enough time to put them all together

Peace Out
